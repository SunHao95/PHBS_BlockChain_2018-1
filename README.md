# Volatility spillover effects in leading cryptocurrencies: A DCC-GARCH Analysis
## Introduction
The cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets. <br>
The cyptocurrency arouses the attention academic community as well as the industry. Through the application of three pair-wise bivariate BEKK models, this paper examines the conditional volatility dynamics along with interlinkages and conditional correlations between three pairs of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin-Ether, Bitcoin-Litecoin, and Ether-Litecoin. (Paraskebi, Shaen and Brain, 2019). In the present paper, the authors investigate connectedness within cryptocurrency markets as well as across the Bitcoin index (hereafter, BPI) and widely traded asset classes such as traditional currencies, stock market indices and commodities, such as gold and Brent oil. A spill over index approach with the spectral representation of variance decomposition networks, is employed to measure connectedness. (Nader, 2018)<br>
In this project, I want to use DCC-GARCH model to analyze the volatility spillover effects in the three leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin.
## Data
The data used in this project contains the returns of the Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin, using each marketâ€™s closing prices from 2015/08/07 to 2019/04/05. The total sample of the observations of each time series is 1338. All the prices are listed in US dollars. The data is downloaded from the [CoinMarketCap website](https://coinmarketcap.com/). <br>
Define the daily closing price returns of cryptocurrency i, y<sub>i,t</sub> as: <br>
y<sub>i,t</sub>=ln(p<sub>i,t</sub>)-ln(p<sub>i,t-1</sub>)<br>
